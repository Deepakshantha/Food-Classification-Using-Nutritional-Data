# Food Classification Using Traditional Machine Learning Models
📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on building and evaluating traditional machine learning models for food classification
using a tabular dataset. The goal is to analyze the dataset, preprocess it effectively, engineer useful features,
and compare multiple ML classifiers to identify the best-performing approach.

## Steps Performed:
Load the food tabular dataset
Analyze class distribution to detect imbalance
Visualize sample rows to understand inter-class variation

## Data Preprocessing
Missing Values Handling
Imputation or row removal for NaN values
Outlier Detection & Treatment
Removal or capping of extreme values
Duplicate Removal
Feature Scaling

## Feature Engineering
Dimensionality Reduction
Label Encoding

## Model Selection & Training
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
XGBoost
Gradient Boosting Classifier

## Evaluation Metrics
