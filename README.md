# Food Classification Using Traditional Machine Learning Models
📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on building and evaluating traditional machine learning models for food classification
using a tabular dataset. The goal is to analyze the dataset, preprocess it effectively, engineer useful features,
and compare multiple ML classifiers to identify the best-performing approach.
